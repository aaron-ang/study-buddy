## Ideas: 

1. Study areas at BU this will include their location with GPS a description of how busy , large and quite each place is and an slef updating data that changes on certin times on how busy everything is. user input helps us and incresses a confidence level for out metrics for how budy. 







2. For sporting events, the program will tell you all sport games going on right now, the score and some statistics and historical data, and then it will say where the user can stream the game, prioritizing cable and free streaming options, and provide a link to the top (free/cheapest) online streaming service to watch that game.
