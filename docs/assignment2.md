# User Stories
## User Story 1:
"As an authorized member of BU, I want to be able to log in, so that I can access the app or continue from where I left off."
### Happy Path:
1. User opens app
2. User is prompted to log in with BU credentials
3. User logs in with BU credentials
6. User preferences, e.g. saved locations, are retrieved (if applicable)
### Exceptions:
User is not authorized, i.e. they do not have a BU account, so they cannot access the app.  
This is important because we want to make sure that only BU students can access the app.  
Some study areas are only available to BU students and faculty so we want to make sure that only authorized users can participate.

## User Story 2:
"As a logged in user, I want to view study areas relative to my location, so that I can find a study area that is convenient for me."
### Happy Path:
1. After logging in, user is redirected to the home page
2. User can see a map of marked study areas relative to their location
3. Each study area has a indicator of the crowd and noise level
4. User can click on a study area to view more information about it
### Exceptions:
Map is not available, e.g. due to API failure.  
User will be directed to a page that displays a list of study areas instead.  
If possible, the list will be sorted by distance from the user's location. Else, it will be sorted alphabetically by building name and room number. 
This is important because we want to make sure that the user can still utilize other features even if the map is not available.
